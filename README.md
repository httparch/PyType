## Overview
PyType is an interactive typing game designed to improve programming fundamental specifically on data types in Python. It is part of the **CodeHub** system within the gamified virtual classroom project. The game challenges users to type Python code quickly and accurately while introducing new concepts to beginners.

### Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/httparch/PyType.git
   cd PyType
   ```
2. Or accesss it here -> https://httparch.github.io/PyType/game.html

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Players type Python code snippets that appear on the screen.

1. **Defeat the monster** by answering the question correctly!
  
2. **Complete the answer** to inflict damage on the monster.
  
3. **Keep typing**—don’t worry about typos and avoid using backspace!
  
4. If you **fail to finish the word in time**, you’ll take damage. If your health reaches zero, the game ends!

5. **Combo streaks**: Typing consecutive correct answers earns you a combo! For every 10 correct inputs, you'll receive a 0.5-point multiplier. However, making a mistake will reset your combo!
